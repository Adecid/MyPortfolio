Hi i am Peter Kolawole, 
a passionate and skilled developer with a wide range of experience in various programming languages and technologies. 
I'm always learning and expanding my knowledge, and i'm passionate about creating innovative and impactful solutions. In my free time, 
i enjoy spending time with family and friends, playing video games, like i mean lots of video games, and reading,
i will also say traveling but most time my money travels before me :) if you know what i mean.

My goal is to use my passion for technology and my skills as a developer to create solutions that make a positive impact on the world. 
I want to use my knowledge to solve real-world problems and help others. I believe technology can be use for good, 
and i'm dedicated to making that happen.

I have experience with a wild range of programming languages and technologies, including Html, css, javascript, SASS and more...
This experience has allowed me to develop a deep understanding of the software development process and how to create high quality solutions. 
Creating this portfolio has place me in a path of advancement and constant learning. in other words. In the time of creating this portfolio, 
i have come to understand that when it comes to programming we are all limited by our knowledge. 
And that we only get to advance more in the tech world by constant learning.

I'm also a problem solver at heart, and i love the challenge of finding innovative solution to complex problem. 
I believe that my skills and experience make me a well-equipped to create impactful solution that make a difference in the world.
